# **PokeWilds Mod App**
This is a small personal project I made to streamline the editing and formatting process of files in the /mods/pokemon/ directory for the fan-project [PokeWilds](https://github.com/SheerSt/pokewilds), a Gen-2 inspired game.
</br>
**DISCLAIMER:**
> [!WARNING]
> Please check the official guide found in _/mods/README.txt_ in the game's source files as I am in no way involved with the PokeWilds development team or offering support for this application.

### How to Run
Download the source files, navigate to the `pokewildsmodsapp` directory and run `java ./PokeWildsModsApp` from the command terminal.
> An executable version may be coming soon(?)
